1. Modifying cron jobs script contents
-------------------------------------
* cp /bin/dash /tmp/exploit; chmod u+s /tmp/exploit;chmod root:root /tmp/exploit

* this one liner copies the dash binary to /tmp as exploit.
* chmod the binary permissions to SUID.Puts StickyBit into file exploit as root. So that anyone runs the binary is effectively root.
* makes owner and group of the file as root.
* Now, we can run this copy of dash with SUID bit set and be root.
