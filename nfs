# Necessary utility kit to interact with NFS shares
 nfs-common (available via apt) for Debian and nfs-utils for arch 
 
 # Show NFS shares
    showmount -e <192.168.1.3>
    
    # Output
    /home/vulnix * 
     ^            ^
     |            |
     [sharename]   ---------[  # This * means any client with any hostname/IP address can mount this.                                ]
                            [   # If the permissions are set to a specific hostname/IP address, then only they can mount that share. ]
    
   
   # Mount an NFS share
   
      Step1: Create a directory to mount (optional)
          mkdir mynfs
          
       Step1: Mount the NFS share to the created directory.
       
        sudo mount -t nfs <IP-address>:<sharename> <mount-point>
        
        example:
        
        sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.1.3:/home/vulnix mynfs
                          ^                ^         ^
                          |                |         |_________[LOCAL mount point]
                          |                |
                          [IP of server]   [NFS Share name]     
                          
                          
                         
Note: NFS authenticates users using their UID/GID combo. If the mounted user's UID/GID is not the same, then the permissions of the local mount point will show up 
UID as nobody and GUID as 4294967294.

# Editing /etc/exports

  /etc/exports is the file responsible for exporting file systems. This file is used to set NFS shares.
  
  Example /etc/exports entry:
  
  /home/vulnix                  *(rw,root_squash)
  ^                             ^  ^     ^_________________________________________________________________________________.
  |.                             |. |___________________________________________.                                            [Additional Permissions]
  [Directory to share]           [Hostname/IP address allowed to mount]         |[Read/Write (Permissions of the client)]    [root_squash disallows client's root user access]
                                                                                                                             [the NFS share.]
