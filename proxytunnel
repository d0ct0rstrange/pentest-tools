proxytunnel via HTTP
-----------------

proxytunnel -p <IP of PROXY>:<PORT of PROXY> -d 127.0.0.1:<LOCAL PORT DESTINATION> -a <LOCAL PORT SOURCE>

Details
--------
-p -- proxy and port. IP and PORT address running the PROXY.
-d -- Destination Port. Where to forward the recieved traffic.(Port address of application)
-a -- Source Port. The localhost port which will be redirected to remote host.

eg: 
proxytunnel -p 192.168.1.5:3128 -d 127.0.0.1:22 -a 1234

Where -p is machine running dynamic proxy,
      -d is our localhost and destination application's port address.(Here, SSH);the traffic FROM remote destination will be received.
      -a is the localhost's source port,from the traffic will be redirected TO destination.

WorkFlow
---------

A proxy is running at 192.168.1.5:3128.
The same server,(or a machine that is accessible only through the server) is running SSH.
We issue the following command on our machine;and starts accessing the remote server's SSh via localhost's port 1234.
Now, the traffic from our machine's localhost's port 1234 will be redirected via the proxy 192.168.1.5:3128 port to the 
Remote SSH server' port 22.
The returning traffic to our localhost will be redirected via he proxy 192.168.1.5:3128 port to our localhost's port 22.
