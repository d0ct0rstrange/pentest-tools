#On server
  ptunnel -v 4 -x password
#Where -v sets verbose level, -x sets password

#On client
  ptunnel -p <server-ip> -lp <local-port-to-forward> -da <destination-address> -dp <destination-port> -x password
  
#Client example
  Ptunnel -p 172.17.0.2 -lp 8080 –da 172.17.0.2 -dp 9001 –x test 

#Tunnel will be created between 127.0.0.1:8080 to 172.17.0.2:9001
  
#Here, -p is used to specify the ptunnel server, located outside the firewalled network. 
#-lp is used to specify the local port to open; which will forward traffic to the remote ptunnel server. 
#-da is used to specify the destination address to forward traffic. Here, the same ptunnel server is receiving packets; however, this can be changed to any address. 
#-dp  is the destination machine’s listening port; the end point where the packets are forwarded to. 
#-x specifies the password to connect to the ptunnel server.
